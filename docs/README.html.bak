There has been [much recent work applying data miners to software engineering](https://goo.gl/NAs3Nu). But what about the
other way around? What software engineering principles should be apply to data miners? After decades
of use of data miners, what services should we demand from our data miners, <span class="o">and</span> how <span class="k">do</span> we build those services?

LURE is a workbench <span class="k">for</span>  exploring SE <span class="k">for</span> data mining.
The premise of LURE is that data miners are _not_ black boxes that we should buy, <span class="k">then</span> uncritically use <span class="s">"as-is"</span>,
without modification.
Rather,
data miners are just software <span class="o">and</span> software contains 100s of design choices that effects what is learned:

- Some of those choices may <span class="o">not</span> be appropriate <span class="k">for</span> your specific needs. 
- Also, some of those choices
might actually be sub-optimum <span class="k">for</span> your domain.
- Further, <span class="k">if</span> you actually understand the internals of a data miner, you can mix <span class="o">and</span> match what data miners
<span class="k">do</span> <span class="k">in</span> order to provide useful <span class="o">and</span> innovative solutions to your data mining tasks.

So LURE is a set of minimal data mining tools designed with the goal of letting their students <span class="s">"roll their sleeves up"</span>
to muck around inside data miners. The code is written <span class="k">in</span> LUA since that makes it very portable, small footprint,
succinct, <span class="o">and</span> hence easily modifiable (<span class="o">and</span> <span class="k">for</span> students who <span class="o">not</span> know how to write LUA code,
I can use LURE as a kind of assignment specification; e.g. write this code <span class="k">in</span> your favorite language).


### Status

LURE is about 
about one-third
built <span class="o">and</span> about one-tenth tested. But its good to have dreams since 
[<span class="s">"a man's (sic) reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for?"</span>](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43745/andrea-del-sarto).
