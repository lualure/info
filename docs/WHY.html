<p>LURE is a set of minimal data mining tools designed with the goal of letting students "roll their sleeves up"
to muck around inside data miners. </p>

<p>The code is written in LUA since:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I can use LURE as a kind of executable specification; e.g. write this code in your favorite language).</li>
    <li>There are some interesting LUA data mining tool likes e.g. <a href="http://torch.ch/">TORCH</a>.</li>
    <li>LUA code is quite readable so for students who not know how to write LUA code;</li>
    <li>LUA code are very succinct and hence easily modifiable;</li>
    <li>LUA programs are not resource intensive;</li>
    <li>That makes it very portable;</li>
</ul>

<p>This  code offers  <em>baseline</em> implementations of a set of <em>software science operators</em> which,
I say, are needed for data science.
But you should be very critical of the technical
choices I made in that implementation. What simplifications did I
make? What better technologies should I use? What did I overlook?
And (here's the trap) if you think you can handle the above in (e.g.)
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>
  or <a href="http://torch.ch/">Torch</a> or using 100 other methods,  I would
lean forward and say "yes? really? show me how".</p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>LURE is about 
about one-third
built and about one-tenth tested. But its good to have dreams since 
<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43745/andrea-del-sarto">"a man's (sic) reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for?"</a>.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>There has been <a href="https://goo.gl/NAs3Nu">much recent work applying data miners to software engineering</a>. But what about the
other way around? What software engineering principles should be apply to data miners? After decades
of use of data miners, what services should we demand from our data miners, and how do we build those services?</p>

<p>The premise of LURE is that data miners are <em>not</em> black boxes that we should buy, then uncritically use "as-is",
without modification.
Rather,
data miners are just software and software contains 100s of design choices that effects what is learned:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Some of those choices may not be appropriate for your specific needs. </li>
    <li>Also, some of those choices
    might actually be sub-optimum for your domain.</li>
    <li>Further, if you actually understand the internals of a data miner, you can mix and match what data miners
    do in order to provide useful and innovative solutions to your data mining tasks.</li>
</ul>
