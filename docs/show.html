<p>So first of all I tried to set a new metatable for tables,
As Shmuel pointed out, table metatables are per-table, so
they don't really work for what you want to do.

  table: 0x493378</p>

<p>A way that will work is to simply replace the tostring
function itself.  Replace it with a function that calls your
table-to-string function for tables, and calls the original
tostring for everything else.
Roberto's Programming in Lua book explains how to write the
table-to-string function.  (The first edition is available
online: <a href="http://www.lua.org/pil/12.1.html">http://www.lua.org/pil/12.1.html</a>.)
As it happens, I happened to write an implementation of just
the functionality you're looking for a few days ago.  It is
below, but I encourage you to try whipping together at least
a simple version of your own before looking at mine.

<p>This script makes tostring convert tables to a
representation of their contents.</p>
